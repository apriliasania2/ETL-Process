# ETL-Process

Developed an end-to-end ETL process using Python (Jupyter Notebook) to support a data visualization competition project. Multiple Excel files containing TV show data were extracted and merged. The dataset was then cleaned by removing irrelevant columns. The final cleaned data was exported as a CSV file and used to build a Tableau dashboard highlighting global TV show trends.
